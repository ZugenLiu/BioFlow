name: ACP phosphopantetheine attachment site binding involved in fatty acid biosynthetic process
namespace: molecular_function
def: "Interacting selectively and non-covalently with the attachment site of the phosphopantetheine prosthetic group of an acyl carrier protein (ACP) as part of the process of fatty acid biosynthesis." [CHEBI:22221, GOC:jl, GOC:vw]
comment: Note that this term was moved from transporter to binding because we decided that ACP is not a true transporter, but instead tethers the growing entity that is acted on to make the fatty acid, so binding is the more correct parent. July 2012.
