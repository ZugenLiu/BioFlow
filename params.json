It's main intended\r\nuses are prediction of drug toxicity of de-novo drugs due to a\r\ndistributed off-target effect and linkage between a phenotype and a\r\ncomplex genotype.\r\n\r\nIt's main advantage is integration of quantitative computational\r\npredictions with prior biological knowledge and ability to integrate\r\nsuch diverse source of knowledge as databases, simulation, publication\r\ndata (currently in dev) and expert knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe application is currently under development and in alpha stage.\r\nHowever, if you desire to use it, you are welcome to do so and fill in\r\nthe tickets if you encounter any issues\r\n\r\nThe license is BSD, but in case of academic usage, please cite the *url*\r\nof this repository (I am currently writing a publication). The full API\r\ndocumentation is available at\r\n[readthedocs.org](http://bioflow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).\r\n\r\nInstallation walk-through:\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you are on Ubuntu 14.04: :\r\n\r\n    > sh ubuntu_14_04_setup.sh\r\n    > pip install git+https://github.com/chiffa/BioFlow.git\r\n\r\nFor more information, refer to the [installation\r\nguide](http://bioflow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide.html#installation-and-requirements)\r\n\r\nUsage walk-through:\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nFire up the databases :\r\n\r\n    > /home/ank/neo4j-yeast/bin/neo4j start\r\n    > nohup /home/ank/mongodb/bin/mongod &\r\n\r\nSetup environment :\r\n\r\n    > bioflow initialize --/home/ank/data_store\r\n    > bioflow downloaddbs\r\n    > bioflow setorg yeast\r\n    > bioflow loadneo4j\r\n\r\nFor more information about data and config files, refer to the [data and\r\ndatabase\r\nguide](http://bioflow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide.html#data-and-databases-setup)\r\n\r\nSet the set of perturbed proteins on which we would want to base our\r\nanalysis :\r\n\r\n    > bioflow setsource /home/ank/source_data/perturbed_proteins_ids.csv\r\n\r\nBuild network interfaces :\r\n\r\n    > bioflow extractmatrix --interactome\r\n    > bioflow extractmatrix --annotome\r\n\r\nPerform the analysis:\r\n\r\n    > bioflow analyze --matrix interactome --depth 24 --processors 4\r\n    > bioflow analyze --matrix annotome --depth 24 --processors 4\r\n\r\nThe results of analysis will be available in the output folder, and\r\nprinted out to the standard output.\r\n\r\nFor more details or usage as a library, refer to the [usage\r\nguide](http://bioflow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide.html#basic-usage).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
