During the internship at DrugDesignTech, several possible ressoruces serving as the backbone for the information transmission algorithm were considered and evlauated. In fact, the parsing of the following ressources was done in parallel by two other interns and took over six weeks, which limited my ability to use any of these databases in my work at that time and limited my interaction with these datasets to the simple evaluation of topology properties of the interaction networks presented in the following ressources and the consistency of the information they contained with the 

NIC-Nature Pathway Interaction Database: [Citation]
A manually curated ressource, this database is availablefor download in Biopax Format. Hower, the protein coverage of this database is rather low. Out of 1300 targets for which the interaction with drugs was computed, less then 500 were present in this databases. In addition to that, this database presented a large amount of relativelay large connex subsets, meaning that many biochemical reactions and protein interaction relations were missing.

Kegg pahtways database [Citation1,Citation2]
One of the most known ressources in the systems biology, it is available for a payant dowload in xml format.
Having a high quality of curation and extensive coverage, KEGG unfortunately have a very limited support for the individual relations between proteins (interactions, participation in the same biochemical reactions), and is mainly centered around pathways. This leads to two major issues. First, proteins in KEGG represent a strongly disconnected set, with several large connex subgraphs of roughly equal size and a large numbre of smaller connex subraphs. This means that it is impossible to restrict the analysis to the main connex subgraph and that the information circulation computation would have to be restricted to the each connex subgraph separately. This is ikely to introduce a biais into secondary effect mechanism reconstruction, by favoring the pathways that are the best studiend. Second pathways often have a hierarchical structure, which needs to be disentangled to be sure that a large pathwyay (such as carbon metabolism) is not treated similarly as a small and higly specific pathway (such as DDT metabolism) fro, the point of viez of the protein interaction proximity that the belonging to such pathways would imply.
A positive point for KEGG, is that it includes known drug and disease specific pathways. However, a manual verification of the pathays included in KEGG led to the conclusion that these drug/disease specific pathways are not relevant to the prediction of the secondary effects of the drugs. The combination of this factor with the previous two led us to omit the integration of the KEGG database in the early iterations of our algorithm.

Unipathway [Citation2012]
This ressource is a joint initiative between the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and University of Grenoble, France. Distinguishing itself as a highly curanted and comprehensive ressource, it is still in it's infancy and thus did not contain, as of summer 2012, suffient number of proteins. Form the set of 1300 targets we were working on, only 250 were represented within Unipathwy. However all the biochemical reactions contained within Unipathways were equilibrated and provided stocheometric coefficients for all the participants. In addition, only one single connex subgraph was present, which respected the "small world network" topology properties, as it was previously documented for the biological networks. All in all, this was one of the most consistent ressources we worked with.

Reactome.org [Citation1, Citation2]
Reactome is one of the most known and comprehensive databases in systems biology. Known well for it's extensive coverage, high precision and presence of the reactional pathay attribution alongside with the metabolome map, it also contains a good deal of additional information, such as participation of physical entities in a complex, existence of post-tranlational modification and existence of specific reactional sites. Available for the download as an BioPaX file this was the database that showed the best comination of coverage of our targets (all of them were mappable to the Reactome.org dataset), and consistency (there is one single large connex node and a couple of smaller ones, due mainly to the orphan reactions of DNA transcription and regulation, which Reactome.org reflects badly).
Unfortunately, the reliable parsing of the Reactome.org file took over six weeks for two interns at DrugDesignTech, which made it impossible for me to include it in the tool that was developed at DrugDesignTech. More detailed description of issues encountered while parsing this database can be found further on in the report.

GO [GO2009 Citation]
Gene othology is a controlled vocabulary developed starting from the end of nineties, whose purpouse is to represent in an organised manner all the knowledge whe have about individual genes and their products, be it from the point of view of their metabolic state or their contribution to different biological processes. Even though this ressource was not of the type that was intially suggested to be used with the method described by [Missiuro2009], provided the easiness of parsing the initial OBO file, almost complete coverage of the set of proteins referenced in SWISS_PROT, it's closeness to the natural language of biologists, it's hierarchical organization and it's total connexity, the GO dataset was chosen as the basis for a first implementation of the Missiuro's information circulation method.
In addition to that, previous publications [Alvarez2011] have shown that GO annotation had a sufficient predictive powre to predict the structural and functional similarity bewteen the proteins, which led us to develop a first variant of the information circulation method. Able to retrieve the most probable mechanisms behind the secondary effects, it was first implemented and tested at DrugDesignTech. The first two months of my internship were consacrated to re-implementing this algorithm and testing it with the data extracted by Pr. Bourne's laboratory, before moving towards an implementation that was close to the inital version.
