The main idea described in this publication is to consider the protein interaction network as an electric circuit, where each protein from the set of the interest (for instance all secondary targets affected by drugs that have a common secondary effect) acts as a source and sink of current at the same time. Each protein-protein interaction or metabolic reaction in which protein is involved can be considered as a resistance linking two proteins. The conductance of the resistance can be set to be proportional to the confidence we have in the existence of a given interaction or importance we would like to give to it. Following this analogy, if we consider each pair of proteins in the interest set as the sources and sinks of the current and calculate the average current flowing through all of the proteins in the network, we will be able to retrieve the proteins that are most critical to the set of proteins of interest. 

From the perspective of exploring potential mechanisms behind the secondary effects, applying this method on the most common unspecific targets of drugs sharing a common secondary effect would allow us to see the "hidden" targets. The "hidden" targets will be the targets with the highest information circulation within the protein interaction network, frequently with the mean informativity superior to the informativity of an individual target. While not affected directly by a drug with a specific secondary effect, such a target will be nonetheless perturbed significantly by due to the interaction with the unspecific targets and will play an important role in mediating a given secondary effect.

In [Missiuro2009]‚Å†, this is method was implemented and tested on the whole proteome of S. Cervisae and C. Elegans. In S. Cervisaem this method allowed the authors to retrieve the essential genes with a precision largely exceeding exceeding any of other existing methods, notably the methods based on the network centrality (where the nodes belonging to the most shortest paths between two physical entities are considered as most informative) and node connexity (the nodes connected to most other proteins are considered as the most important). In case of C. Elegans, the authors were able to retrieve not only the essential genes, but also the genes that were specific to the muscle development, by considering the proteins that were expressed in the muscle tissue differently compared to the rest of the worm body.

This unsurprising, porovided that the analogy between the electrical network and the network of the confidence is quite straight-forward. In fact, if we consider the variational calculus framework, the Kirchoff's laws of electrical conduction within networks are simply the rules that lead to the minimization of energy loss due to thermal dissipation. In other words, they lead to the electic current to distribute itself in a way that maximizes the electric current flow through the paths offering the least resistance, while accounting for the contribution of the edges that have a higher resistance. All in all it leads to a maximal electric current at a given potential difference or the minimal potential difference at a given electric current.

In case of information flow, applying Kirchoff's laws for the protein-protein interaction network or a metabolic network would lead to maximizing the information flow through the paths in which we have the most confidence. If we consider that each protein in our set of interest have some information to transmit to all the other proteins, or to a set of "hidden" proteins that are shared with other proteins in the set, this method will calculate the information circulation that leads to the least information loss during the transmission. Alternatively, this method's output can be seen as the most probable paths of information transmission, ponderated by the confidence we have in the interest of this path for our property of interest (for instance the secondary effect). 

This approach is excpetional in two regards. First, it it allows to easily integrate existing biological knowledge, even if it comes from very heterogeneous sources with wildly varying levels of confidence. For instance we are able to integrate the interaction or metabolic maps coming from different systems biology databases and integrate them into one network, while ponderating each source or even each interaction by the degree of confidence we have in this interaction. In the same fashion, we can also add the information about belonging of different physical entities to the same pathways, while ponderating the protein-protein interaction induced by belonging to the same pathway in a way that best represents the confidence we have in the existence of this pathway or the prior information we have about the importance of this pathway. Finally, if we are willing to integrate ALL of the information about a given biological system that was ever published, from the moment we are able to efficiently extract the informaion about the connection between the physical entities from the publications.

# Physical information also can be encoded by considering such concepts as overall water pressure, ionic content (osmose pressure), cell membrane surface evolution, etc...

Second, by introducing the error marging on the confidence of the implication of a protein in a given process or a given protein-protein interaction, it allows to compute the commulated margin on hte confidence of the information circulation along a path and ultimately topredict wherther the results retrieved are completely trustworthy or if the prediction is likely to be untrustworthy.

Third, this method allows an easy and rapid modification to integrate the existing expert knowledge that is domain-specific. For instance, if the secondary effect is expected to act only on a specific organ, such as liver or heart, organ-specific protein interaction network can be examined. In the same fashion, if the drug is investigated for it's positive secondary effect, such as action against a different disease, and if a set of targets important for the disease is alredy known, a disease-specific information circulation map can be calculated and it's intersection with the drug-specific information circulation map can be considered, pretty much like the potential methods suggested in [!!!review here!!1]. If the intersection is sufficiently big, the drug will likely have an effect against this disease and the specific targets that carry at the same time a high drug-specific and disease-specific informativity will allow to predict the most likely pahtways that mediate the drug unexpected therapeutic drug action.

Finally, this method enables very straightforward estimation of the tradeoff a "dirty" drug would have between efficiency v.s. potential secondary effects can be made for the diseases with well-studied molecular nature. If a drug-specific information circulation affects gives a high informativity score tpo the proteins that are essential for a disease (high informativity score for hte disease-specific information circulation map), but in a limited fashion the proteins that are essential to for the cell survival and functionning (proteins with high informativity score overall or a high informativity score for the processes essential for cell or organism survival), it means that the drug is likely to have an effect on the disease, while having a limited toxicity.
