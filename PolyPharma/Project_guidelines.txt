This file regroups the TODOs for the project in the future.
***********************************************************

Add additional Sources/Dimensioins
==================================

# TODO: perform a recovery of important domains from PDB

# TODO: perform a recovery of post-translational modification sites in the normal proteins

# TODO: Perform a recovery of a larger database of the RNAs, both as protein transcription elements and as regulatory
#       elements

# TODO: Import the DNA / epigenetic annotation ontology into the database to account for the DNA (un)-availability
#       and for the DNA transport towards specific (activation or repression regions)

# TODO: Cast in the database Protein Aboundances so that it becomes one-and-for-all import
#       Problem: what are we to do in case we are willing to use a specific organ and not a general database?

# TODO: Add ENSEMBL idnetifiers and gene names indexing


Improve crosslinking between different databases
================================================

# TODO: perform a search in the UNIPROT Database in order to imoprove the annotation based on the DisplayNames
#           => this is done separately by a matching/lookup module

# TODO: we might want to parse the traceability of the all the compounds and link by adding the xref parsed
#       information to them. This might be critical to adress the issues imposed by the difference in the database
#       versions

# TODO: import modification feature insertion from the reactome database to account for post-translational modifications

# TODO: verify if GO_Terms analysis conserves the "regulation relations or not.

# TODO: add fulltext indexes to the nodes

From the mathematical point of view
===================================

# TODO: Get rid of Cholesky decomposition: it is not appliable in our case because of presence of null eigenvalues
# In fact there are as many eigenvalues as there are connex segments in the graph

# TODO: replace pickling by JSON wherever appliable

# TODO: add the clustering of proteins according to the GO annotation similarity

# TODO: add the evaluations of Zipf-ittude for the proteins

# TODO: add random matrix filtering-out for the "too noizy" conductions


Utils module
============

# TODO: In the xml_doctor, add correlation between presences?
