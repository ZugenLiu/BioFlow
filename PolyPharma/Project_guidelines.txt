This file regroups the TODOs for the project in the future.
***********************************************************

Add additional Sources/Dimensioins
==================================

# TODO: perform a recovery of important domains from PDB

# TODO: perform a recovery of post-translational modification sites in the normal proteins

# TODO: Perform a recovery of a larger database of the RNAs, both as protein transcription elements and as regulatory
#       elements

# TODO: Import the DNA / epigenetic annotation ontology into the database to account for the DNA (un)-availability
#       and for the DNA transport towards specific (activation or repression regions)



Improve crosslinking between different databases
================================================

# TODO: perform a search in the UNIPROT Database in order to imoprove the annotation based on the DisplayNames
#           => this is done separately by a matching/lookup module

# TODO: we might want to parse the traceability of the all the compounds and link by adding the xref parsed
#       information to them. This might be critical to adress the issues imposed by the difference in the database
#       versions
